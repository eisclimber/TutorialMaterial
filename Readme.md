# Tutorial Material

In this repo you will find materials I've created on my own for some of my many tutorials at Uni TÃ¼bingen.  
The materials do not contain any old exercises or anything regarding their solution.  

Note that many of the files are in german as the courses itself were in german. The courses are:
- Info2: Introduction to Java
- Algo: Various basic algorithms, their usage and performance
- ETI: Introduction to technical Computer Science (logic, electro-physics,... )
